# string4
This mini-library contains four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) based on string 
manipulation.

Since every programming language has her own limitations about integer size, these functions performing four basic arithmetic 
operations aim to be up to those limitations by manipulating numbers as strings, in other words character lists.

Aim of the library is going beyond the integer size limit while performing primality check for large numbers for which is necessary for cryptographic operations.
